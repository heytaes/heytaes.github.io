PAARA will again be holding its annual Field Day event at Bedwell Bayfront Park in Menlo Park on June 28 & 29 this year.

### Stations
In an expansion from last year’s effort, we will be competing in Class 3A, with 3 primary HF stations, adding a dedicated digital mode station running FT4/8 on 20 Meters.  **Marty** [W6NEV](https://www.qrz.com/db/W6NEV) will captain this station.

In addition, we will have 2 other HF stations, running amplifiers to increase transmit power following last  year’s rule change allowing up to 500 watts, captained by **Ric** [N6AJS](https://www.qrz.com/db/N6AJS) primarily our CW station and **Harry** [K4YR](https://www.qrz.com/db/K4YR), running mostly phone.

We have always had a BIG signal from our excellent location, featuring sloping terrain angled down to the saltwater marsh at the edge of the bay giving us the “saltwater amp” effect, increasing our signals even more.

Our intention is to keep these stations staffed and operating for the entire 24 hours of the event.  That means there will be ample opportunities to work the biggest operating event of the year, from excellent stations in an outstanding location.  Please sign up for some seat time.  Advance sign-ups can be made at [FieldDaySchedule](http://tinyurl.com/FieldDaySchedule).

As always, we will have our excellent GOTA station to give interested visitors who have never been on HF the opportunity to operate under the guidance of one of our coaches.

Returning to the mix this year will be UHF/VHF/satellite operations, captained by **Justin** [AI6YM](https://www.qrz.com/db/AI6YM), featuring his impressive home-brewed azimuth/elevation rotor system for the satellite antenna array he has designed and built.

### Antenna Parties
Advance preparation for Field Day will include several (likely 3) antenna work parties at [KG6LWE](https://www.qrz.com/db/KG6LWE)’s San Martin QTH, and Network Day to connect all the radios and logging computers on a couple of tables in Marty’s garage to work out any connection or communication issues before getting to the park.

We have always enjoyed these “work parties” and have found them to be good team-building opportunities, as well as good practice in assembling the antennas and getting them up in the air.  If you’re interested in coming out for a couple of fun days in the sun with the team, please let **Doug** [KG6LWE](https://www.qrz.com/db/KG6LWE) know.  Planning for these is already under way.

### Installation
We will be returning to our previous practice of beginning setup at the park on Thursday afternoon, with the erection of one of our AB-621 military mast systems with our big triband KT-34XA beam antenna on top.  Work will continue Friday morning with the erection of another AB621, with another beam, the 20 Meter monobander for Marty’s digital station, followed by the assembly and erection of the monster 4 element 40 Meter beam on the tower trailer.  An 80 Meter dipole will also be strung up for nighttime operations.   GOTA’s Buddihex antenna will likely go up Saturday morning.

We will again set up the food and socializing area at the usual spot at the fork of the road leading up to the ridge.  This entails setting up the big red canopy, anchoring it against the wind and dragging tables and chairs out of the box trailer and setting them up

With the step up to 3A, there will be even more to do at the park, so we’re looking for  volunteers to help with setup and teardown too.  Many hands make light work of all of this, so please bring yours out to the park to join the big team effort.

### You work, we feed
As always, the `You work, we feed` rule will be observed, staring with burgers, hot off the grill at the San Martin work parties, with make-it-yourself sandwiches for lunch at the park on Friday and Saturday, and hot soup and hot dogs for dinner Saturday night.  Thanks to [Rob](https://www.qrz.com/db/KC6TYD)) for feeding us so well.

### Questions
For questions about Field Day or to volunteer to help, you can contact Doug, KG6LWE PAARA’s Field Day Coordinator at his new PAARA e-mail address, <kg6lwe@paara.org> (Thanks [Sorin](https://www.qrz.com/db/KN6YUH)).

## Safety Guidelines

For a printable version of the Safety Guidelines, please [click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J4zDdLOIcLpmyfRRWEDBjy1PZdddvFCUoqU4WL1VSAg).

PAARA's Field Day safety guidelines were written and updated for Field Day 2025 by [Rob Fenn KC6TYD](https://www.qrz.com/db/KC6TYD), the club's Field Day safety officer.

### Introduction

To facilitate the ARRL’s Field Day Safety Officer requirements, PAARA has appointed safety officers to be on site for the duration of the event. In an effort to ensure everyone’s safety during Field Day, the following information will contain abbreviated park rules and regulations, general hazards, and setup and teardown guidelines. It is expected that all volunteers, regardless of involvement, follow these guidelines.

### Bedwell Bayfront Park Rules and Regulations (Abbreviated) 

To protect our long lasting relationship with the City of Menlo Park and the park staff, we need to be conscientious and respectful of the privileges we have been granted for the entire duration of Field Day. This abbreviated list of rules and regulations must be followed by all volunteers and participants: 

* Pets are to remain on leash and under control at all times
* Bikes are restricted to paved trails and roads 
* Plants and wildlife are to be left undisturbed 
* Litter and trash are to be disposed of properly 
* Fire, smoking, alcohol, or weapons of any kind are prohibited
* Drones and other unmanned aircraft systems are not allowed
* Tents or other enclosed structures are not allowed

#### Exemptions for Field Day 

* You’re allowed to park your vehicle at the designated Field Day site
* You’re allowed to remain on site past the posted park closure times

### Site Access

The main gate is open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. After 9 p.m., the main gate will be closed and locked. Use the talk-in frequency (listed below) to arrange for someone to open the gate. To exit, locate the assigned gate keeper. You should expect delays; please plan ahead.

### Talk-In and Onsite Coordination Frequencies

**Talk-In:** [N6NFI repeater](https://www.repeaterbook.com/repeaters/details.php?state_id=06&ID=620), 145.230 MHz, negative offset, 100 Hz PL. 

**On-site:** Simplex 147.450 MHz. **It is strongly recommended that all Field Day staff use and monitor this frequency for onsite coordination.**

### Parking

Due to the limited space, volunteers and visitors must park along the shoulder of the road. Some of the station locations have turn outs that can accommodate a few vehicles. Drivers must park in an orderly fashion and at no time block the roadway accesses. Only designated vehicles used in the process of setup and teardown will be allowed to drive off the main roadways. Do not park vehicles with internal combustion engines in high grass due to the hazard of fire. All drivers must adhere to the posted speed limit.

### In the Event of an Emergency; First Aid Supplies

<mark> In the event of an emergency, 911 should be called immediately.</mark> In the event that EMS/Fire is needed after the main gate is locked, immediate coordination will need to take place to open the gate and to escort EMS/Fire vehicles to the Field Day site. The Safety Officer and lead coordinator shall be advised if 911 is activated. Unless otherwise stated, Safety Officer Rob Fenn, KC6TYD, will have first aid supplies available for minor emergencies.  

### Weather

Ambient temperatures can be significantly high during the day. Winds can become severe in the afternoons. Individuals are encouraged to hydrate appropriately. Volunteers and participants are reminded to dress accordingly and using **layers** is recommended. Night time temperatures can be chilly. Short pants worn during the hot day may not provide the warmth you’ll need during the night.

### General Hazards

#### Wildlife

The park is a wildlife refuge and as such harbors a variety of animals including snakes, skunks, and spiders. To avoid unintentional encounters with the wildlife, all volunteers shall remain on designated trails unless working at a station. It is understood that our Field Day stations and antennas will be assembled in areas that are off the main trails. As such, it is essential to always be aware of your surroundings. 

#### Nighttime Activity

There is no artificial lighting at the park, and the moon will be waxing. After dusk, it will be very dark. If you are planning to be on site after dusk, you must bring a headlamp or flashlight and be extra cautious where you walk. 

#### Trip Hazards

The fields at Field Day are riddled with ruts and holes from burrowing wildlife. The Safety Officer will make every attempt to fill in those holes in heavy traffic areas. During and after setup, caution must be taken to avoid trip hazards that could include tower structures, stakes, guy wires, extension cords, and cabling. Identified trip hazards as well as structures that could be walked into, will be marked. High visibility paint, flagging tapes, and cones will be used where appropriate.

### Generator Safety Guidelines and Fire Extinguishers

Each station is powered by a gas generator. Each generator will be placed far enough away from the operating position to reduce noise. A minimum perimeter of 3 feet around the generator will be clear of any vegetation. Extra fuel will be stored separately from the generator. 
A Class ABC fire extinguisher shall be placed near each generator. Station Captains and volunteers are encouraged to review the proper use of the extinguisher, such as the PASS technique: Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep. 

### Electrical Supply

### PPE, Tools, and Gear Safety

#### Personal Protective Equipment

Volunteers directly involved in the assembly/disassembly of masts and towers are strongly encouraged to wear a hard hat. OSHA/ANSI standard hard hats are available for purchase on Amazon for $16. Due to the uneven terrain and the potential for injuries while working with heavy objects, wearing boots with proper ankle support are recommended. Gloves are recommended where applicable.

#### Tools

Extreme caution should be taken when using tools, especially when working above other volunteers. Examples would include while standing on a ladder or while tethered to a tower. 

#### Tower Climbing

Only experienced tower climbers will be allowed to climb towers and will use proper climbing harnesses doing so. 

#### Ladder Use

If a large ladder is used, another volunteer must hold the ladder while the work is being done. 

### Assembly/Disassembly Guidelines for Antenna Masts and Towers

#### Assembly/Disassembly captain

For each tower or antenna mast assembly/disassembly, a captain that has experience in the assembly/disassembly processes will be designated. Prior to starting, the captain will assign specific tasks to volunteers and explain the role for which they will be responsible. To eliminate any confusion the captain will be the only person calling out instructions during the assembly/disassembly. When working with the tower and masts, volunteers need to be aware of potential pinch points that could cause injury to fingers and other body parts. Caution should be taken when wearing loose clothing as they could be trapped or caught during assembly/disassembly. 

#### AB-621 mast

Due to the many components involved while working with this mast, a minimum of seven volunteers is strongly recommended during assembly/disassembly. This allows for one captain, one volunteer for each guy wire, one volunteer to load the mast section onto the crank stand, and one volunteer to operate the mast brake and crank. The mast brake operator must verbalize when the brake is being placed on or off. Once the mast brake has been set, no one will touch the mast brake handle until the crank stand is brought back up and is supporting the weight of the mast.

#### Tower trailer

The recommended number of volunteers to assemble/disassemble for the tower trailer is six. This allows for one captain and five volunteers to assist with guy wires, halyards, cabling, and operation the tower cranks. Wheel chocks should be placed to insure unexpected movement.

### Hospitality Canopy

A clear and flat area for the hospitality canopy is recommended. Any ruts or holes in the ground should be marked or filled with dirt. BBQs, hibachis, or any grill or stove are prohibited. Canopies and sunshades must be properly staked and secured. As stated earlier, electrical appliances will be used. Caution should be taken not to overload the circuit. A trash can should be made available for waste.

## Field Day By Jack Daane, KR6CD

Field day is an emergency communication exercise. Each year, during the last full weekend in June, amateur radio operators presume there has been a major disruption to electric power and commercial communication systems. The power is off, there is no local phone service, no long distance, no cell phone, no internet service, even some of the government radio systems have been knocked out. In response, amateurs assemble two-way radio stations operating on emergency power to transmit messages over the amateur bands.

In a real emergency, radio amateurs would send messages, telegram style, for public officials over these stations. For example, the mayor might write a message to send to the governor, hand it to the radio amateurs who would then relay the message, station by station, to the state capital and deliver it. Similarly, the reply from the governor would be relayed back to the mayor.

That’s the idea behind field day, practice setting up a radio station on short notice and operate it on emergency power. Many amateur clubs such as PAARA take part.

Interested in participating? Well, there are three major activities to work on: moving and setup of the equipment on Friday, operating Saturday and Sunday, and then disassembly on Sunday. Everybody is welcome to join in.

First comes assembling the PAARA station on Friday. The electric generators, radios, towers, antennas, and shelters must be brought to the field day site and put together into working radio stations. This gives you a great hands-on opportunity to work with a variety of equipment. You’ll be piecing towers together, mounting antennas and rotators on them, threading transmission lines on them, and then hoisting them skyward. Down on the ground, there are power supplies and two-way radios to hook up. The generator has to be cabled to the radio equipment. You’ll see equipment you’ll never find in a radio store, and you actually get to use it, not just look at it.

Next comes operating the stations, starting on Saturday. There probably won’t be an actual disruption to commercial communication systems during field day, so instead of relaying telegrams for public officials, amateurs cont act one another to determine the range of each station.

Operators generally work in pairs at each radio. One person operates, the other logs contacts. The operator calls “CQ field day, CQ field day”, and gives the station’s call sign, W6OTX. When a distant operator responds to the call, the logger records the call sign and location of the far station. It is very similar to typical ham radio contesting, and clubs compete to see who gets the most points by contacting the most stations. This goes on for 24 hours straight, but obviously operators work in shifts of a few hours at a time.

During field day there are stations in the U.S., Canada, and many other countries participating on most of the amateur bands, including HF, VHF, UHF, and satellite. Most of the operating modes are used as well, such as CW, voice, packet, FAX, and even TV. Field day is a great opportunity to try a mode that you might not have at your own station.

PAARA typically has a CW and a SSB station on HF plus a station on VHF. Other bands and modes might also be used depending upon what the club members choose to do during field day.

Since a logger can serve as the control operator, you can be the radio operator and use modes that your own license class does not permit. For example, during field day, Technician class licensees can use voice or CW on the HF bands.

After the official field day operating period ends on Sunday, all that equipment has to come back down and go into storage for the next field day, or maybe a true communication emergency.

There is still work to do after field day weekend has past. The contact lists must be submitted to the ARRL for compilation. In addition, the field day planners get together to analyze the contact data to see where each station could reach, where it didn’t reach, and to revise the plan for the next field day in order to maximize the radio coverage area.

Field day is a lot of fun, a great way to work with a team of amateur radio operators, and try out the biggest variety of equipment you’ll probably ever see in one location.
