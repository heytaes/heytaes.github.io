# Welcome, New Hams

We're looking forward to seeing you at our next meeting or event!

## Free Membership

As a new ham, you’re eligible for a one year free PAARA membership! Please talk to the club’s Secretary **Ric Hulett** [N6AJS](https://www.qrz.com/db/N6AJS){:target="_blank"} in person at our next monthly meeting, or by email at <secretary@paara.org>.

## Discord
We invite all PAARA members and friends to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/E2s4rez64d){:target="_blank"} and discuss anything ham radio related, such as: homebrew, [POTA, SOTA](https://paara.org/ontheair.html){:target="_blank"}, digital modes, or anything else that you might be interested in.

## Newsletter

The club publishes a [monthly newsletter](https://paara.org/newsletter.html){:target="_blank"} full of interesting stories and information, with the archive going all the way back to 1971! Members get immediate access to a digital or a hard copy (mailed) delivered a few days before the monthly meeting.

## Meeting videos
We recommend you to check out our [monthly meeting archive](https://paara.org/meetings.html#past-meetings){:target="_blank"}, where you’ll find video recordings of the great speakers we had over the years. Alternatively, you can browse recordings on the [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@paarapresentations-c3w){:target="_blank"} directly.

## Field Day

Besides the monthly meetings, we organize a big [field day](https://paara.org/fieldday.html){:target="_blank"} event every June, two PAARA in the Park events (check out the [May 2025](https://paara.org/events/20250503.html){:target="_blank"} one), and one other club event (check out the [August 2024](https://paara.org/events/20240824.html){:target="_blank"} one).
