## Details

My adventure into Ham Radio started in the mid 50s with a one transistor crystal set I got for my 9th birthday. I roamed the neighborhoods clipping on to fences, down spouts and anything metal to see what I could pull in on that tiny earphone. I was enamored with radio waves. (Licensed as WV6HXL ‘ 58) The magic that happens when out on the trail miles from no where and able to make contact using a simple wire in a tree and a tiny CW rig you've built yourself is what really does it for me still today! It's that same thrill I got from having my very 'First QSO' aka hearing my call sign coming back to me from the other station. SOTA (Summits on The Air) is my current passion!
