## Details

Rick grew up in Menlo Park and was PAARAgraphs editor from 1972 - 76, then moved to the Boston area to attend grad school (and regularly QSO with the original W6NIR from university club stations W1AF and W1MX.)  He worked at MIT Lincoln Laboratory for nearly 20 years before returning to the SF Peninsula in 1999 to start his current position at the Stanford Research Institute.  Rick is interested in the history of radio technology, in restoring communications equipment from the last century, and in capturing "natural radio" signals at wavelengths greater than 30 kilometers.
